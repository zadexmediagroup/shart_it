Welcome to SHART-IT 
“A fart may start it, but a shart finishes the job.”

What is SHART-IT?

SHART-ITis the unapologetic tribute to life’s most unexpected moments.
Forget fancy, polished cryptos—SHART-ITis here to celebrate the glorious
 chaos of those "oops" moments that keep us human (and laughing). 

Why SHART-IT?

Because every accidental shart deserves its day in the sun. SHART-IT 
isn’t just a coin; it’s a revolution—a cheeky, messy, and proudly
unfiltered movement that reminds us all to own the chaos. 

How to Get SHART-IT:

1. Visit the official Phantom website and download 
the Google Chrome extension. Install it on your browser, 
then fund your wallet by transferring SOL from an exchange or another wallet.

2. Navigate to the Dexscreener website and connect your Phantom wallet.

3. Use the search bar to enter the contract address (CA) for $SIT.
Double-check to ensure you're selecting the legitimate pair,
as fake pairs may exist.

4.Enter the amount of SOL you want to swap for $SIT, 
confirm the transaction, and you're all set! 

Tokenomics:
Total Supply: 1 billion
Tax: NO
Liquidity Pool: Locked
